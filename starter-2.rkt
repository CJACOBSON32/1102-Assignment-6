;; some examples of Racket weirdness you will need to work around
(define x 3)
(define y 5)
(set! y 6)

;; in the interpreter, try:
;;     (set! x 10)
;;     (set! y 10)
;; first one fails, second one works
;; --> if you want a variable you can change later, will need both
;;     define and set! in your macro
;; (create z 99) could be a handy macro to define and set a variable

(define z (list y))
;          (list 6)
(set! y 8)
;; in the interpreter, try
;;        y
;;        z
;; it looks like values don't update properly.  how can we make it update properly?

(define z2 (list (quote y)))
(set! y 11)
;; what is z2?
;; it's '(y)
;; how to get back the 11?

;; how about (my-eval (first z2)) ?
;;    -> that's how we'll store lists of nodes
